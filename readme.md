selection to neon glow
======================

This is a GIMP Python script to easily create a neon glow effect
from a selection.

![Selection to neon glow effect](/preview.png?raw=true "preview")

How to use it
-------------
Download and install [GIMP v2.8](https://www.gimp.org/) and copy the file
`selection_to_neon_glow.py` into the following directory:

	.\GIMP 2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins\

After you've put the file in the plug-ins directory, open GIMP and there
should be a new menu item available, under `Script-Fu -> Selection to neon glow`.

Known bugs / trouble shooting
-----------------------------
When merging the new layers into a single layer, it somehow looks less "glowy".
Don't know what causes this is, possible bug in GIMP, if anyone knows why please let me know.
